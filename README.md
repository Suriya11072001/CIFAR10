#CIFAR-10 Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow

#Key Skills: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, CNN, Deep Learning, Image Classification, Computer Vision, Data Augmentation, Model Evaluation

â€¢Built an image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow and Keras to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 distinct categories such as airplanes, cats, and trucks. Applied preprocessing techniques including normalization and one-hot encoding, and leveraged real-time image data augmentation to improve generalization. Designed and trained a deep CNN architecture incorporating batch normalization and dropout layers to prevent overfitting. Used the Adam optimizer, early stopping, and model checkpointing to optimize training performance. Achieved over 80% test accuracy and visualized training progress and predictions using Matplotlib.
